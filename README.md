<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03/EcoRede)

This Project consists of an application that helps people learn more about wildlife and endangered species, either through the learn page of the app or by snapping photos of animals to get information about them.

This app is written in Swift. It utilizes various features and APIs to provide users with an educational experience about different species of animals and their conservation status.

The key features of the app include:

1. Species Identification: Users can take photos of animals they encounter in the wild, and the app uses image recognition technology to identify the species. The app then retrieves relevant information about the identified animal, including its scientific name, habitat, behavior, and conservation status.
2. Species Database: The app maintains a comprehensive database of various wildlife species, including both common and endangered animals. Users can browse through the database to access detailed information, such as species descriptions, threats they face, and conservation efforts being made to protect them.
3. Educational Content: The app provides a dedicated "Learn" section that offers interactive content to educate users about different wildlife species, their ecosystems, and the importance of conservation. This section covers topics such as biodiversity, habitat loss and climate change.


By combining the power of image recognition and educational content this app aims to raise awareness about wildlife and endangered species, fostering a sense of responsibility and encouraging users to take action to protect our natural world.
