That's why I created this app that uses the camera or a photo from the photos library, to help people identify animals and learn interesting and fun facts such as their habitats, diet, and behavior. By making it easier for people to learn about the animals around them, I hope to inspire appreciation and awareness about the importance of preserving our planet's diverse ecosystems.")
